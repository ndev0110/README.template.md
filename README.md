## 💭 Fun fact!
Did you know that Google's first tweet in 2009 was written in binary code? It seemed like an alien language to many people back then. The direct translation of the tweet from binary to English is "I'm feeling lucky." How fascinating is that? Check out the original tweet [here.](https://twitter.com/Google/status/1251523388?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1251523388%7Ctwgr%5E1940702572a674ce96e7eaf2cd5f40babe894316%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fscope.ie%2Ffun-and-interesting-facts-about-technology%2F)
